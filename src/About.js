            A brief overview of my inspiring journey to becoming a front-end
            developer:

        <p>
          I am a 28-year-old woman from France who has taken an inspiring
          journey to discover my true passion in life. While many of my peers
          went off to university with clear goals, I explored various subjects,
          striving to find my own path. Although my initial university studies
          didn't resonate with me, and I eventually chose to work as a waitress,
          this period taught me resilience and adaptability. When COVID-19 hit,
          the hotel where I worked unfortunately closed. This setback gave me an
          opportunity to rethink my career. Through a support service at the
          unemployment centre, I connected with a professional who was dedicated
          to helping me uncover a fulfilling career path. Her guidance was
          invaluable, and after many months, I discovered my passion for
          front-end development. Now, I am excited to pursue this new and
          exciting career.
