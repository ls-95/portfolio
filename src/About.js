        <p>
          My name is Laetitia. As it is a French name, it may be challenging to
          pronounce for those unfamiliar with it, particularly because the
          pronunciation differs from its spelling. The English pronunciation is
          similar to 'Latisha,' while the French pronunciation is 'LÃ©tisia.'

          I am passionate about the outdoors, with a particular love for hiking

          for 10 years, and in the south of France for 11 years, which has
          provided me with a deep cultural understanding and proficiency in both
          languages.{" "}

            A brief overview of my inspiring journey to becoming a front-end
            developer:
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a 29-year-old woman from France who has taken an inspiring
          journey to discover my true passion in life. While many of my peers
          went off to university with clear goals, I explored various subjects,
          striving to find my own path. Although my initial university studies
          didn't resonate with me, and I eventually chose to work as a waitress,
          this period taught me resilience and adaptability. When COVID-19 hit,
          the hotel where I worked unfortunately closed. This setback gave me an
          opportunity to rethink my career. Through a support service at the
          unemployment centre, I connected with a professional who was dedicated
          to helping me uncover a fulfilling career path. Her guidance was
          invaluable, and after many months, I discovered my passion for
          front-end development .{" "}
          <span className="Yellow">
            Now, I am excited to pursue this new and exciting career
